Day 1 of 100 - Azure Static Portfolio Website

Welcome to Day 1 of my #100DaysOfCloudDeployment challenge

Today, I deployed a professional static cloud portfolio site using Azure App Service on the Free (F1) tier.
About the Project

This is not a Hello World it's a beautifully styled HTML + CSS profile card showing my skills, contact links and cloud role. It’s hosted on Azure and styled with a custom gradient, emojis and responsive layout.

Tools & Technologies
•	Azure App Service (Windows, .NET F1)
•	App Service Editor (Kudu)
•	Static HTML with CSS
•	Font: Google Poppins
•	Responsive design + buttons + emoji

Deployment Steps
1. Created App Service on Azure (Windows, F1).
2. Opened App Service Editor (Kudu).
3. Replaced `wwwroot/index.html` with this custom portfolio HTML.
4. Opened the app’s URL in the browser boom.
5. Took screenshots and then deleted the resource group.

What I Learned
•	How to create and style a personal portfolio site using plain HTML/CSS.
•	How to deploy to Azure App Service without writing backend code.
•	How to manage cloud resources wisely and delete after use.

This project has been deleted on Azure (to save cost) but lives here on GitHub as proof of work for recruiters and collaborators.
